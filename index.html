      1- Can Victor Gyökeres Fix Our Striker Problem?

      Let’s be honest — we’ve had a big problem with strikers for years. Since
      Thierry Henry and Van Persie, we haven’t had a proper No. 9 who can score
      goals when it really matters.107); font-family: Georgia, 'Times New
      Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 50px;">1- Latest Transfer News We tried
      Giroud, Lacazette, Aubameyang, Jesus, even Havertz... Some were good, but
      none of them were the real solution. We always missed that killer striker
      in the big games. Now, we’ve signed Victor Gyökeres — a Swedish striker
      who was amazing for Sporting CP. He’s strong, fast, powerful, and he
      scores goals. A real number 9. But the big question is: Is he finally the
      one? Can he break the curse and lead us to the title? We hope so — because
      if we want to win the Premier League or go far in the Champions League, we
      NEED a striker who can finish. This time, it has to work.

      . From London to Lagos, from New York to New Delhi — Arsenal fans are
      everywhere. There are official fan groups (called Arsenal Supporters’
      Clubs) in many countries. These groups bring fans together to watch
      matches, support the team, and build a strong community. Arsenal Fans in
      the Arab World 🇸🇦🇦🇪🇲🇦🇶🇦 The Arab world has millions of Arsenal fans. There
      are official or semi-official groups in: Saudi Arabia UAE Morocco Algeria
      Iraq Jordan Tunisia These groups organize meetups, post match content, and
      show massive support for the club. What About Egypt? 🇪🇬 Egypt has one of
      the biggest Arsenal fanbases in the region. There are many large Facebook
      groups with thousands of Egyptian Gooners who talk about matches, players,
      and share news every day. So the support is already here — strong and
      loud. But we still don’t have an official Arsenal supporters' club in
      Egypt like other countries do. It’s Time for Recognition Egyptian Arsenal
      fans are loyal, passionate, and active — online and offline. We believe
      it’s time to take the next step: ➡️ Get official recognition from Arsenal
      ➡️ Build an official fan group: Arsenal Egypt ➡️ Show the world that Egypt
      is Red

      It all started in 1886, in south London, when a group of workers at a
      weapons factory decided to form a football team. They called it Dial
      Square, but soon changed the name to Arsenal. From day one, the club had a
      fighting spirit — built by workers, for the people. In the early days, we
      moved to Highbury, and that stadium became our home for over 90 years.
      Legends played there. Dreams were made there. Then came the golden
      years... Arsène Wenger arrived in 1996 and changed everything. He brought
      beautiful football, big trophies, and global respect. We went invincible
      in 2003–04 — 38 games, no losses. No one else has done it in Premier
      League history. That team? Pure magic. After Wenger, things got shaky —
      new managers, ups and downs. But the fans? We stayed loyal. Because
      Arsenal is family. Now under Mikel Arteta, the project is alive again.
      Young players, exciting football, and big dreams. We’re back fighting for
      the league, back in the Champions League, and back to being proud. From
      the factories of Woolwich to the world stage — Arsenal is more than a
      club. It’s a feeling. It’s us.

      Over the years, many great players wore the Arsenal shirt and became
      legends — not just for their skills, but for their hearts and love for the
      club. First, there was Dennis Bergkamp — the “Non-Flying Dutchman.” A
      genius on the ball, he made impossible passes and scored unforgettable
      goals. He brought class and creativity that changed our game forever. Then
      came Tony Adams, the captain, the rock. Born and raised in Arsenal’s
      youth, he led the team with courage and strength. His leadership helped us
      win trophies and build the Arsenal spirit. And who can forget Thierry
      Henry? The greatest Arsenal goalscorer of all time, a true legend. Fast,
      skillful, and deadly in front of goal. He gave us moments of pure magic
      and made us dream big. There’s also Patrick Vieira, the midfield warrior.
      Strong, fearless, and a true leader on the pitch. He battled in the middle
      and inspired the team to fight for every ball. These legends shaped who we
      are. Their names are written in our hearts — and their spirit lives on in
      every player who wears the Arsenal shirt today. From Bergkamp’s genius to
      Henry’s goals — these legends are the soul of Arsenal.
